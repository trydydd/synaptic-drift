## 1. Source Discovery

Starting from the path given to `--source`, the builder discovers documentation files to process.

**Recursion**: subdirectories are walked recursively by default. There is no `--no-recurse` flag in MVP.

**Extension whitelist**: only files matching `.md`, `.html`, or `.htm` are included. All other files are skipped with a debug-level log message (e.g. `DEBUG: skipping docs/diagrams/arch.png — not a supported extension`).

**Walk order**: discovered files are sorted lexicographically by their full relative path (relative to the parent of the `--source` argument). This sort order determines chunk ID assignment and therefore the `normalized_content_hash`. It is a correctness requirement — without deterministic ordering, the same source tree would produce different hashes on different platforms or runs.

Example walk order for `--source ./docs`:

```
docs/api/auth.md
docs/api/billing.md
docs/getting-started.md
docs/guides/deployment.md
docs/guides/monitoring.md
```

Python's `os.listdir` and `pathlib.Path.iterdir()` return entries in filesystem-dependent order. The builder must explicitly sort after discovery, not rely on the iteration order.

## 2. Page Construction

Each file becomes exactly one page entry in `pages.json`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | Sequential integer, assigned in lexicographic file order starting at 1 |
| `url` | Relative path from the `--source` root, preserving the `--source` directory name. `--source ./docs` + file at `./docs/auth/oauth.md` = `docs/auth/oauth.md`. Only leading `./` is stripped. |
| `title` | Extracted from the first `# heading` in the file, or the filename (without extension) if no heading is found |
| `content_hash` | SHA-256 of the full file content after normalization |

## 3. Chunking

The builder uses a custom token-walker built on `markdown-it-py` to split documents at structural boundaries:

- Every heading (`#` through `######`) starts a new chunk.
- Fenced code blocks are atomic — never split mid-fence.
- `heading_path` is built by construction as an ancestor stack while walking the token stream.
- When a section exceeds `max_chunk_tokens` (default 800 tokens), the chunker splits at the next paragraph boundary.

**Heading path construction**: the relative file path (minus extension) is used as a prefix, followed by the full heading ancestry. The `--source` directory name is stripped from the prefix to avoid redundancy.

| Source file | Heading in file | heading_path |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/auth/oauth.md` | preamble (no heading) | `auth/oauth` |
| `docs/auth/oauth.md` | `# OAuth2` | `auth/oauth / OAuth2` |
| `docs/auth/oauth.md` | `## Client Credentials` (under `# OAuth2`) | `auth/oauth / OAuth2 / Client Credentials` |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `# Installation` | `getting-started / Installation` |

The file path prefix ensures that identically-named headings in different files (e.g. every file has `# Overview`) are disambiguated in search results.

**Chunks per file**: a file with no headings produces a single chunk containing the full file content, with `heading_path` set to the file path prefix only.

**Future — hybrid search**: a later phase will add an embedding generation step immediately after chunking. Each chunk's vector would be computed at build time (no model dependency on the consumer) and bundled into the `.ctx` archive. See [`docs/hybrid-search.md`](hybrid-search.md).

## 4. Summary Generation

Each chunk receives a one-line summary, generated heuristically at build time.

**Heading-aware prefix**: the summary is prefixed with the leaf heading node when available. For example, a chunk under `### STDIO Transport (Default)` produces `"STDIO Transport (Default): STDIO is the default transport..."` rather than extracting the first transitional sentence. Preamble chunks (no heading) use first-sentence only. Headings longer than 60 characters are used as the summary on their own.

**For prose-heavy chunks**: extract the first prose sentence (heading lines and list items excluded). A sentence boundary is a period, question mark, or exclamation mark followed by whitespace or end-of-string. If the first sentence exceeds 200 characters, truncate at the last word boundary before 200 characters and append `...`.

**For code-heavy chunks** (more than 50% of content is inside code fences): extract the first function or class signature from the leading code block. If no signature is found, fall back to the first sentence of any prose in the chunk.

The summary field is present in the schema and the generation strategy can be upgraded in the future without a format change. The heuristic path has no LLM dependency.

### LLM summary enrichment (`--summarizer llm`)

`synd build --summarizer llm` opts into a stronger summary: the heuristic sentence above, with a model-generated sentence **appended**. The generated sentence restates the chunk in plain developer vocabulary alongside the library's own terms, which lifts retrieval on paraphrased and vocabulary-mismatched queries; keeping the heuristic sentence in front preserves the chunk's own tokens as exact-match capital for terse, direct queries. This is the first shipping step of the hybrid-search program — see `docs/decisions.md` **D31** for the format/prompt/reproducibility rationale and `docs/hybrid-search.md` for what comes next.

**Usage** (a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as vLLM):

```
synd build my-lib@1.0.0 --source ./docs --output ./packs \
  --summarizer llm \
  --summarizer-url http://localhost:8000/v1 \
  --summarizer-model <served-model-name>
```

`--summarizer-url`, `--summarizer-model`, and `--summarizer-api-key` also read from `SYND_SUMMARIZER_URL` / `SYND_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` / `SYND_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY`. Heuristic generation remains the default — `llm` is strictly opt-in.

**Reproducibility — the summary lockfile.** Model output at temperature 0 is not byte-stable across engine versions and hardware, so a summary *lockfile* (`<output>/<package>@<version>.summaries.jsonl` by default, or `--summary-lockfile PATH`) is the build input of record. It maps each chunk's content hash to its summary and pins the prompt version and model in a header line. A warm rebuild reuses cached summaries byte-for-byte and calls the model only for new or changed chunks — so `identical source + identical lockfile → identical chunk bytes`, with no model in the loop. Keep the lockfile alongside the source (commit it) for reproducible republishing; delete it to regenerate from scratch. Changing the prompt version or the model is rejected against an existing lockfile — remove it deliberately to regenerate.

**Failure behavior.** If the endpoint is unreachable, returns a malformed response, or emits a degenerate summary (empty, or over 600 characters), the build fails with a `SummarizerError` (exit code 6) rather than shipping a pack that mixes LLM and heuristic summaries. Summaries generated before the failure are flushed to the lockfile first, so re-running the build retries only the chunks that failed.

**Cost.** Roughly one chunk per generated sentence, concurrent by default. A cold build of a ~6,500-chunk corpus on a local 27B at concurrency 16 takes on the order of an hour; warm rebuilds from the lockfile complete in seconds.

**Locality note.** This is the one point in `synd` where corpus content leaves the local process: with `--summarizer llm`, each chunk's heading path and content are sent to the endpoint you configure. It is a **build-time** call made by the pack *publisher*; it does not affect the query-time guarantee that consuming a pack makes no outbound network calls. Point `--summarizer-url` at an endpoint you control (e.g. a local vLLM) to keep the whole pipeline on your own infrastructure.

**Provenance.** LLM-summarized packs record `summarizer`, `summarizer_model`, and `summarizer_prompt_version` in `manifest.json` (visible via `synd inspect`); heuristic packs leave these unset.

## 5. Content Normalization

Normalization is applied to chunk content before hashing. The same normalization function (`synd.builder.normalizer`) is used at both build time and verify time — this is the hash stability guarantee.

The normalization rules are defined in `architecture.md` (Token Efficiency > Content normalization):

- Collapse runs of blank lines to a single blank line
- Strip HTML boilerplate, nav, breadcrumbs, footer, version banners
- Remove "Edit this page" links, "See also" sections that are only link lists
- Normalize Unicode whitespace to ASCII
- Preserve code block formatting exactly (indentation matters)
- Preserve table formatting

**What is NOT normalized**: content inside fenced code blocks is preserved verbatim (whitespace, indentation, blank lines). Normalization only applies to prose and markup outside of code fences.

## 6. Chunk ID Assignment

Chunk IDs are sequential integers starting at 1, assigned in the order chunks are produced by the pipeline:

1. Files are processed in lexicographic order (from step 1)
2. Within each file, chunks appear in document order (top to bottom)
3. Each chunk receives the next available ID

This ordering is deterministic: the same source tree always produces the same chunk ID sequence. The `normalized_content_hash` depends on this ordering (chunks are concatenated in ascending ID order before hashing).

## 7. Hash Computation

Three hashes are computed during build:

**Per-chunk `content_hash`**: SHA-256 of the individual chunk's content after normalization. Used for detecting which specific chunks changed between pack versions.

**Per-page `content_hash`**: SHA-256 of the full page content after normalization. Stored in `pages.json`.

**`normalized_content_hash`**: SHA-256 of all chunk content strings, each normalized, concatenated in ascending chunk ID order with a `\n` separator. This hash is independent of metadata (heading paths, summaries, page IDs) and only changes when the actual text content changes.

**`pack_digest`**: computed after archive assembly (step 9). SHA-256 of the full `.ctx` archive bytes, with the `pack_digest` field value in `manifest.json` replaced by an empty string during computation.

## 8. Manifest Construction

The manifest is built from CLI arguments and computed values:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | Hardcoded: `2` |
| `pack_format` | Hardcoded: `"synd-text-v1"` |
| `package` | From CLI argument (`my-lib` in `my-lib@1.0.0`) |
| `version` | From CLI argument (`1.0.0` in `my-lib@1.0.0`) |
| `pack_digest` | Computed after archive assembly |
| `normalized_content_hash` | Computed from step 7 |
| `chunks` | Count of chunks produced |
| `pages` | Count of pages (files) processed |
| `lifecycle_state` | From `--lifecycle` flag (default: `draft`) |
| `policy_profile` | From `--policy-profile` flag (optional) |
| `owner` | From `--owner` flag (optional) |
| `doc_version_status` | Default: `stable` for local builds |
| `source_url` | The `--source` path as provided (normalized: `./` stripped) |
| `created_at` | UTC timestamp at build time |
| `created_by` | `"synd/<version>"` |

Fields not provided via CLI flags are omitted from the manifest (not set to null).

## 9. Archive Assembly

The final `.ctx` file is a zip archive containing:

```
my-lib@1.0.0.ctx
├── manifest.json
├── chunks.jsonl
├── pages.json
├── signatures/
│   └── manifest.sig    (empty directory unless signing is configured)
└── embeddings.bin      (future — hybrid search only, see docs/hybrid-search.md)
```

Assembly sequence:

1. Write `chunks.jsonl` — one JSON object per line, in chunk ID order
2. Write `pages.json` — array of page objects, in page ID order
3. Write `manifest.json` with `pack_digest` set to empty string
4. Create the zip archive containing all three files (plus empty `signatures/` directory); all ZIP entries use a pinned `date_time` of `(2021, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0)` to ensure the archive is byte-for-byte reproducible across writes
5. Compute `pack_digest` over the archive bytes
6. Rewrite `manifest.json` inside the archive with the real `pack_digest` value
7. Write the final `.ctx` file to the `--output` directory

The output filename is `<package>@<version>.ctx` (e.g. `my-lib@1.0.0.ctx`).

## Example: End-to-End

Given this source tree and command:

```bash
synd build my-lib@1.0.0 --source ./docs --output ./packs
```

```
docs/
├── getting-started.md      # contains: # Installation, ## Prerequisites, ## Quick Start
├── auth/
│   └── oauth.md            # contains: # OAuth2, ## Client Credentials, ## Authorization Code
└── api/
    └── endpoints.md        # contains: # API Reference, ## Users, ## Billing
```

The pipeline produces:

**File processing order** (lexicographic):
1. `docs/api/endpoints.md`
2. `docs/auth/oauth.md`
3. `docs/getting-started.md`

**Pages** (3 entries in `pages.json`):
1. `{ "id": 1, "url": "docs/api/endpoints.md", "title": "API Reference", ... }`
2. `{ "id": 2, "url": "docs/auth/oauth.md", "title": "OAuth2", ... }`
3. `{ "id": 3, "url": "docs/getting-started.md", "title": "Installation", ... }`

**Chunks** (8 entries in `chunks.jsonl`, IDs 1–8):
1. `{ "id": 1, "page_id": 1, "heading_path": "api/endpoints / API Reference", ... }`
2. `{ "id": 2, "page_id": 1, "heading_path": "api/endpoints / API Reference / Users", ... }`
3. `{ "id": 3, "page_id": 1, "heading_path": "api/endpoints / API Reference / Billing", ... }`
4. `{ "id": 4, "page_id": 2, "heading_path": "auth/oauth / OAuth2", ... }`
5. `{ "id": 5, "page_id": 2, "heading_path": "auth/oauth / OAuth2 / Client Credentials", ... }`
6. `{ "id": 6, "page_id": 2, "heading_path": "auth/oauth / OAuth2 / Authorization Code", ... }`
7. `{ "id": 7, "page_id": 3, "heading_path": "getting-started / Installation", ... }`
8. `{ "id": 8, "page_id": 3, "heading_path": "getting-started / Installation / Prerequisites", ... }`

**Output**: `./packs/my-lib@1.0.0.ctx`

## URL and Crawled Builds

`synd build --source <url>` (llms.txt/llms-full.txt fetch, or the general crawler for any other docs-site root URL) reuses the same pipeline from step 3 onward (chunking through archive assembly). See `docs/decisions.md` D21 (URL fetch) and D28 (general crawler) for the fetch/crawl design. The differences from the local-directory pipeline described above:

- **Source discovery** (step 1): replaced by `fetch_page()` for `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` URLs, or `src/synd/builder/crawler.py`'s sitemap-seeded BFS link-following for a general docs-site root. HTML pages are converted to Markdown via `html_to_markdown()` (`markdownify` + BeautifulSoup4); Mintlify-style `.md` endpoints are cleaned via `process_mdx()` in `src/synd/builder/mdx.py`.
- **Page construction** (step 2): `url` is the canonical web URL instead of a file path; `title` is extracted from the first `#` heading (or HTML `<title>`/`<h1>` for the HTML path).
- **Ordering**: crawled/fetched pages are sorted by canonical URL (lexicographic) before chunk ID assignment, preserving the deterministic hash guarantee. `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` builds keep the source's own index order instead — that order is the site's curated priority.
- **source_url on chunks and pages**: full `https://` URLs instead of relative file paths.
- **Manifest provenance**: crawled builds additionally record `crawl_pages_fetched`, `crawl_truncated`, and `crawl_max_pages` — optional manifest properties (no schema version bump) visible via `synd inspect`.

No MVP schema or format decisions needed to change to support this.
