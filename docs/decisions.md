# Tank — Decision Log

Decisions made during architecture and pre-implementation planning, with reasoning and rejected alternatives. This document exists so that future contributors (human or agent) don't re-open settled questions.

## Format

Each entry records: the decision, the alternatives considered, why we chose what we chose, and when it can be revisited.

---

## D1: Implementation Language — Python

**Decision**: implement Tank entirely in Python.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Rust**: single-binary distribution, memory safety in archive validator, 10-50x faster normalization/hashing. Rejected because: 2-3x slower development velocity, less mature MCP SDK, higher contributor barrier for the target audience (enterprise teams), and `chunkana` is Python-only (would need rewrite or PyO3 bridge defeating single-binary goal).
- **Hybrid (Python + Rust hot paths)**: Python for orchestration, Rust for validator and normalizer via PyO3. Rejected because: premature optimization. Sub-10ms FTS5 queries are achievable in pure Python. Ship MVP, measure, optimize only if performance is actually a problem.
- **Go**: good CLI story, single binary. Rejected because: no MCP SDK, no chunkana equivalent, weaker ecosystem for the specific libraries needed.

**Revisit when**: performance profiling shows Python is the bottleneck for large documentation sets (thousands of pages), or if the Rust MCP SDK matures significantly.

## D2: Python Version — 3.11+

**Decision**: require Python 3.11 or later.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Python 3.10**: would require `tomli` backport for TOML parsing. 3.10 is in security-fix-only mode, EOL October 2026. Adds a dependency for diminishing benefit.
- **Python 3.12+**: too restrictive. 3.11 is widely available in enterprise environments and gives us `tomllib` in stdlib plus `str | None` union syntax.

**Revisit when**: Python 3.11 reaches EOL (October 2027).

## D3: Summary Generation — Heuristic

**Decision**: generate one-line summaries heuristically at build time. First sentence for prose chunks, leading function/class signature for code-heavy chunks.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **LLM-generated summaries**: more accurate, better natural language. Rejected because: adds runtime dependency (API key or local model), costs money per build, makes builds non-deterministic (same input → different output), requires network (violates local-first constraint), and increases build time dramatically.
- **No summaries (heading_path only)**: simpler, zero generation logic. Rejected because: the progressive disclosure pattern relies on summaries to help agents decide which chunks to expand. Heading paths alone are often too terse (`API / Users` tells you nothing about what's in the chunk).

**Revisit when**: the `summary` field schema supports upgrading the strategy without a format change. A future `--summarizer llm` flag could opt into LLM generation for users who want it.

## D4: source_url Convention — Relative Paths for Local Builds

**Decision**: `source_url` is always populated, never null. Local builds store the relative path from the `--source` argument (e.g. `--source ./docs` + `auth/oauth.md` = `docs/auth/oauth.md`). Only leading `./` is stripped.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **file:// URLs**: absolute paths like `file:///home/user/project/docs/auth/oauth.md`. Rejected because: makes `.ctx` packs completely unportable. The pack would only make sense on the machine where it was built.
- **Paths relative to source root (stripping the source dir)**: `auth/oauth.md` instead of `docs/auth/oauth.md`. Rejected because: loses useful context. If someone sees `auth/oauth.md` they have to guess where that lives in the project. `docs/auth/oauth.md` is unambiguous.
- **Nullable source_url with fallback logic**: allow null, fall back to `packages.source_url` at query time. Rejected because: adds query-time complexity and branching. Always-populated is simpler for both the implementation and consumers.

**Revisit when**: Phase 2 adds web crawling; crawled builds will use full `https://` URLs in the same field. No format change needed.

## D5: pack_digest Zeroing — Empty String

**Decision**: when computing `pack_digest`, set the field value to `""` in manifest.json, hash the archive bytes, then write the real digest back.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Remove the key entirely**: cleaner semantics ("field doesn't exist yet"). Rejected because: removing and re-adding a JSON key introduces key-ordering sensitivity. Different JSON libraries may serialize remaining keys in different orders, breaking the hash. Would require canonical JSON serialization (sorted keys) at both build and verify time — an additional subtle correctness requirement.
- **Sidecar file (`.ctx.sha256`)**: hash the archive directly, store digest externally. Rejected because: two files to track, easy to lose the hash file, breaks the self-contained single-file property of `.ctx` packs.
- **Hash everything except manifest**: `pack_digest` covers only `chunks.jsonl` + `pages.json`. Rejected because: doesn't detect tampering of manifest metadata (someone could change `lifecycle_state` from `draft` to `approved` undetected).
- **Don't store digest inside the archive**: store it only in the lockfile and packages table after import. Rejected because: you can't verify a `.ctx` file in isolation — you need an external source of truth to check against.

**Revisit when**: never. This is a format-level decision that's baked into the verification sequence.

## D6: Token Counting — Character Heuristic

**Decision**: `token_count` is computed as `len(content) // 4`. Documented clearly as an approximate estimate for budget planning.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **tiktoken (cl100k_base)**: exact counts for Claude/GPT-4 class models. Rejected because: adds a ~2MB dependency to `tank[build]`, and the "right" tokenizer varies by model (cl100k, o200k, etc.). Since `token_count` is advisory — agents use it to estimate "will this fit?" not for exact accounting — the heuristic is good enough.
- **Multiple tokenizer counts** (generic + Anthropic + OpenAI): maximum accuracy across models. Rejected because: ~30 bytes of bloat per chunk in `chunks.jsonl` for accuracy that doesn't change any decision. An agent with 2000 tokens of budget doesn't care if a chunk is 387 or 412 tokens.

**Revisit when**: agents start making tight budget decisions based on `token_count` and the ~20% error margin causes problems. The field can be recomputed at build time without a format change.

## D7: HTML Handling — Markdown-First for MVP

**Decision**: Markdown is the primary supported format. `.html` files are accepted (extension whitelist) but processed via basic tag removal only. Boilerplate stripping (nav, footer, breadcrumbs, sidebar) is deferred to Phase 2.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Tag-based stripping with element/class matching**: strip `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, elements with class matching `breadcrumb`, `sidebar`, etc. Rejected for MVP because: the primary use case is local documentation which is overwhelmingly Markdown. Building a robust HTML boilerplate detector before we have real crawled HTML to test against is speculative. Phase 2's crawler will produce real HTML that informs the stripping rules.
- **Reject HTML entirely in MVP**: only accept `.md` files. Rejected because: some projects keep docs as HTML (e.g. generated API docs). Basic tag removal is trivial to implement and better than refusing the files.

**Revisit when**: Phase 2 crawler implementation begins and we have real-world HTML documentation to inform stripping rules.

## D8: Source Tree Handling — Recursive with Lexicographic Sort

**Decision**: `tank build --source <path>` recurses subdirectories by default. Files are discovered by extension whitelist (`.md`, `.html`, `.htm`), sorted lexicographically by full relative path. This sort order determines chunk ID assignment and `normalized_content_hash`.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Flat only (no recursion)**: process only top-level files in the source directory. Rejected because: real documentation is almost always nested (`docs/api/`, `docs/guides/`, etc.). Requiring users to flatten their docs first is a poor UX for zero benefit.
- **Configurable recursion (`--no-recurse`, `--include`, `--exclude`)**: full flexibility. Rejected for MVP because: adds CLI complexity without clear demand. Deferred — can be added later without breaking anything.
- **Filesystem iteration order (unsorted)**: rely on `os.listdir` / `pathlib.iterdir()` order. Rejected because: iteration order is filesystem-dependent (arbitrary on Linux, sometimes alphabetical on macOS/Windows). Same source tree would produce different hashes on different platforms, breaking the integrity guarantee.

**Revisit when**: users request `--no-recurse` or glob-based filtering. The architecture accommodates these as additive features.

---

## D9: Error Model — Emergent via TDD

**Decision**: start with a base `TankError` class. Discover and add specific exception subclasses during TDD as failure modes emerge from writing tests.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Define full exception hierarchy up front**: lay out every exception class and exit code before writing code. Rejected because: speculating about failure modes without implementation experience leads to either over-engineering (exceptions that never get raised) or gaps (real failures that don't fit the pre-defined classes). TDD naturally surfaces the real failure modes.

**Revisit when**: after MVP implementation is complete, review the exception hierarchy for consistency and document the final exit code mapping.

---

## D10: Test Fixtures — Static Archives + Pytest Factories

**Decision**: use static fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for integration tests (sample source trees, known-good `.ctx` packs, malformed archives) and pytest factory functions for unit tests (individual chunks, normalization cases, policy evaluation).

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Static fixtures only**: committed test data for everything. Rejected because: unit tests for normalization and chunking need many small variations that would bloat the fixtures directory. Factories are more expressive for parameterized tests.
- **Programmatic fixtures only**: build all test data in code. Rejected because: archive validation tests need real `.ctx` files with known byte-level properties (corrupted archives, path traversal entries, bad signatures). These are hard to construct programmatically and easier to inspect as static files.

**Revisit when**: the test suite grows large enough that fixture management becomes a problem.
