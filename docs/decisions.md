# Tank — Decision Log

Decisions made during architecture and pre-implementation planning, with reasoning and rejected alternatives. This document exists so that future contributors (human or agent) don't re-open settled questions.

## Format

Each entry records: the decision, the alternatives considered, why we chose what we chose, and when it can be revisited.

---

## D1: Implementation Language — Python

**Decision**: implement Tank entirely in Python.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Rust**: single-binary distribution, memory safety in archive validator, 10-50x faster normalization/hashing. Rejected because: 2-3x slower development velocity, less mature MCP SDK, higher contributor barrier for the target audience (enterprise teams), and `chunkana` is Python-only (would need rewrite or PyO3 bridge defeating single-binary goal).
- **Hybrid (Python + Rust hot paths)**: Python for orchestration, Rust for validator and normalizer via PyO3. Rejected because: premature optimization. Sub-10ms FTS5 queries are achievable in pure Python. Ship MVP, measure, optimize only if performance is actually a problem.
- **Go**: good CLI story, single binary. Rejected because: no MCP SDK, no chunkana equivalent, weaker ecosystem for the specific libraries needed.

**Revisit when**: performance profiling shows Python is the bottleneck for large documentation sets (thousands of pages), or if the Rust MCP SDK matures significantly.

---

## D2: Python Version — 3.11+

**Decision**: require Python 3.11 or later.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Python 3.10**: would require `tomli` backport for TOML parsing. 3.10 is in security-fix-only mode, EOL October 2026. Adds a dependency for diminishing benefit.
- **Python 3.12+**: too restrictive. 3.11 is widely available in enterprise environments and gives us `tomllib` in stdlib plus `str | None` union syntax.

**Revisit when**: Python 3.11 reaches EOL (October 2027).

---

## D3: Summary Generation — Heuristic

**Decision**: generate one-line summaries heuristically at build time. First sentence for prose chunks, leading function/class signature for code-heavy chunks.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **LLM-generated summaries**: more accurate, better natural language. Rejected because: adds runtime dependency (API key or local model), costs money per build, makes builds non-deterministic (same input → different output), requires network (violates local-first constraint), and increases build time dramatically.
- **No summaries (heading_path only)**: simpler, zero generation logic. Rejected because: the progressive disclosure pattern relies on summaries to help agents decide which chunks to expand. Heading paths alone are often too terse (`API / Users` tells you nothing about what's in the chunk).

**Revisit when**: the `summary` field schema supports upgrading the strategy without a format change. A future `--summarizer llm` flag could opt into LLM generation for users who want it.

---

## D4: source_url Convention — Relative Paths for Local Builds

**Decision**: `source_url` is always populated, never null. Local builds store the relative path from the `--source` argument (e.g. `--source ./docs` + `auth/oauth.md` = `docs/auth/oauth.md`). Only leading `./` is stripped.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **file:// URLs**: absolute paths like `file:///home/user/project/docs/auth/oauth.md`. Rejected because: makes `.ctx` packs completely unportable. The pack would only make sense on the machine where it was built.
- **Paths relative to source root (stripping the source dir)**: `auth/oauth.md` instead of `docs/auth/oauth.md`. Rejected because: loses useful context. If someone sees `auth/oauth.md` they have to guess where that lives in the project. `docs/auth/oauth.md` is unambiguous.
- **Nullable source_url with fallback logic**: allow null, fall back to `packages.source_url` at query time. Rejected because: adds query-time complexity and branching. Always-populated is simpler for both the implementation and consumers.

**Revisit when**: Phase 2 adds web crawling; crawled builds will use full `https://` URLs in the same field. No format change needed.

---

## D5: pack_digest Zeroing — Empty String

**Decision**: when computing `pack_digest`, set the field value to `""` in manifest.json, hash the archive bytes, then write the real digest back.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Remove the key entirely**: cleaner semantics ("field doesn't exist yet"). Rejected because: removing and re-adding a JSON key introduces key-ordering sensitivity. Different JSON libraries may serialize remaining keys in different orders, breaking the hash. Would require canonical JSON serialization (sorted keys) at both build and verify time — an additional subtle correctness requirement.
- **Sidecar file (`.ctx.sha256`)**: hash the archive directly, store digest externally. Rejected because: two files to track, easy to lose the hash file, breaks the self-contained single-file property of `.ctx` packs.
- **Hash everything except manifest**: `pack_digest` covers only `chunks.jsonl` + `pages.json`. Rejected because: doesn't detect tampering of manifest metadata (someone could change `lifecycle_state` from `draft` to `approved` undetected).
- **Don't store digest inside the archive**: store it only in the lockfile and packages table after import. Rejected because: you can't verify a `.ctx` file in isolation — you need an external source of truth to check against.

**ZIP entry timestamps**: all entries in a `.ctx` archive are written with a fixed `date_time` of `(2021, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0)`. The build writes the archive twice — once with `pack_digest: ""` to compute the digest, then again with the real digest. Without pinned timestamps, the two writes could land in different 2-second DOS timestamp buckets, producing different ZipInfo metadata and making the verifier unable to reproduce the hash. The pinned date is arbitrary and must never change (it is baked into every `.ctx` file ever produced).

**Revisit when**: never. This is a format-level decision that's baked into the verification sequence.

---

## D6: Token Counting — Character Heuristic

**Decision**: `token_count` is computed as `len(content) // 4`. Documented clearly as an approximate estimate for budget planning.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **tiktoken (cl100k_base)**: exact counts for Claude/GPT-4 class models. Rejected because: adds a ~2MB dependency to `tank[build]`, and the "right" tokenizer varies by model (cl100k, o200k, etc.). Since `token_count` is advisory — agents use it to estimate "will this fit?" not for exact accounting — the heuristic is good enough.
- **Multiple tokenizer counts** (generic + Anthropic + OpenAI): maximum accuracy across models. Rejected because: ~30 bytes of bloat per chunk in `chunks.jsonl` for accuracy that doesn't change any decision. An agent with 2000 tokens of budget doesn't care if a chunk is 387 or 412 tokens.

**Revisit when**: agents start making tight budget decisions based on `token_count` and the ~20% error margin causes problems. The field can be recomputed at build time without a format change.

---

## D7: HTML Handling — Markdown-First for MVP

**Decision**: Markdown is the primary supported format. `.html` files are accepted (extension whitelist) but processed via basic tag removal only. Boilerplate stripping (nav, footer, breadcrumbs, sidebar) is deferred to Phase 2.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Tag-based stripping with element/class matching**: strip `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, elements with class matching `breadcrumb`, `sidebar`, etc. Rejected for MVP because: the primary use case is local documentation which is overwhelmingly Markdown. Building a robust HTML boilerplate detector before we have real crawled HTML to test against is speculative. Phase 2's crawler will produce real HTML that informs the stripping rules.
- **Reject HTML entirely in MVP**: only accept `.md` files. Rejected because: some projects keep docs as HTML (e.g. generated API docs). Basic tag removal is trivial to implement and better than refusing the files.

**Revisit when**: Phase 2 crawler implementation begins and we have real-world HTML documentation to inform stripping rules.

---

## D8: Source Tree Handling — Recursive with Lexicographic Sort

**Decision**: `tank build --source <path>` recurses subdirectories by default. Files are discovered by extension whitelist (`.md`, `.html`, `.htm`), sorted lexicographically by full relative path. This sort order determines chunk ID assignment and `normalized_content_hash`.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Flat only (no recursion)**: process only top-level files in the source directory. Rejected because: real documentation is almost always nested (`docs/api/`, `docs/guides/`, etc.). Requiring users to flatten their docs first is a poor UX for zero benefit.
- **Configurable recursion (`--no-recurse`, `--include`, `--exclude`)**: full flexibility. Rejected for MVP because: adds CLI complexity without clear demand. Deferred — can be added later without breaking anything.
- **Filesystem iteration order (unsorted)**: rely on `os.listdir` / `pathlib.iterdir()` order. Rejected because: iteration order is filesystem-dependent (arbitrary on Linux, sometimes alphabetical on macOS/Windows). Same source tree would produce different hashes on different platforms, breaking the integrity guarantee.

**Revisit when**: users request `--no-recurse` or glob-based filtering. The architecture accommodates these as additive features.

---

## D9: Error Model — Emergent via TDD

**Decision**: start with a base `TankError` class. Discover and add specific exception subclasses during TDD as failure modes emerge from writing tests.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Define full exception hierarchy up front**: lay out every exception class and exit code before writing code. Rejected because: speculating about failure modes without implementation experience leads to either over-engineering (exceptions that never get raised) or gaps (real failures that don't fit the pre-defined classes). TDD naturally surfaces the real failure modes.

**Revisit when**: after MVP implementation is complete, review the exception hierarchy for consistency and document the final exit code mapping.

---

## D10: Test Fixtures — Static Archives + Pytest Factories

**Decision**: use static fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for integration tests (sample source trees, known-good `.ctx` packs, malformed archives) and pytest factory functions for unit tests (individual chunks, normalization cases, policy evaluation).

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Static fixtures only**: committed test data for everything. Rejected because: unit tests for normalization and chunking need many small variations that would bloat the fixtures directory. Factories are more expressive for parameterized tests.
- **Programmatic fixtures only**: build all test data in code. Rejected because: archive validation tests need real `.ctx` files with known byte-level properties (corrupted archives, path traversal entries, bad signatures). These are hard to construct programmatically and easier to inspect as static files.

**Revisit when**: the test suite grows large enough that fixture management becomes a problem.

---

## D11: FTS5 Configuration — Minimal for MVP, Tuning Deferred

**Decision**: ship MVP with a minimal FTS5 configuration: raw query passthrough, uniform BM25 column weights, default tokenizer, and `heading_path` stored in the `chunks` table but not indexed in FTS5.

**What this means in practice**: the MVP implementation uses roughly 30–40% of FTS5's available capability. Specifically:

- `fts.py` passes queries directly to `MATCH` with no preprocessing — stopwords, articles, and filler terms consume BM25 capacity
- BM25 column weights are uniform `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)` — `summary` and `content` are weighted identically
- Default tokenizer — no stemming, no code-aware tokenization, no prefix matching
- `heading_path` is the strongest relevance signal in documentation search and is not indexed

**Alternatives considered (deferred, not rejected)**:

- **Column weighting** — `bm25(chunks_fts, 2.5, 1.5, 1.0)` with heading > summary > content. Deferred: requires adding `heading_path` to the FTS5 virtual table, which is a schema migration.
- **Query preprocessing** — stopword filtering, term normalisation. Deferred: adds code with no correctness risk but material quality impact; belongs in v0.2.0 where FTS5 tuning is scoped.
- **Prefix queries and synonym expansion** — `auth*` matching `authentication`; a small static dict for common technical abbreviations. Deferred: same scope.
- **Custom tokenizer** — porter stemmer or unicode61 with diacritics removal. Deferred: low-priority for technical documentation where exact terms dominate.

**Revisit when**: v0.2.0 FTS5 tuning work begins. The four improvements are ordered by impact: (1) add `heading_path` to `chunks_fts` with 2.5× weight, (2) tune BM25 column weights, (3) query preprocessing, (4) synonym expansion. Measure search quality before and after before considering embeddings.

## D12: MCP Tool Surface — Single Tool vs Split ✓ Implemented (v0.2.0)

**Decision**: ship MVP with a single `query-docs` tool accepting a `detail` parameter (`"summary"` or `"full"`); split into separate `search`/`fetch` tools in v0.2.0.

**The problem with the single-tool surface**: `detail="full"` sounds better than `detail="summary"` to an LLM agent. The parameter name nudged agents toward the expensive single-step path — fetching full content speculatively without a prior relevance pass — which is the footgun the two-step pattern is designed to prevent.

**Resolution (v0.2.0)**:

```
search   query, packages, limit, max_tokens  → always returns summaries + chunk_ids only
fetch    chunk_ids, max_tokens               → always returns full content by ID
```

This enforces the two-step pattern architecturally: `search` cannot return full content; `fetch` cannot do speculative full-content search. Eliminates the footgun without any stateful enforcement. Implemented in `src/tank/server.py`; documented in `docs/MCP.md`.

**`max_tokens` default rationale**: `max_tokens` defaults to `None` (no budget enforcement) by design. A default of e.g. `4000` would silently trade away recall — with BM25 noise, the most relevant chunk can land at position 8 or 12, and a tight budget would exclude it with no signal to the agent. `limit` is the right knob for controlling result count; `max_tokens` is an explicit opt-in for agents with known token constraints.

---

## D13: Summary Heuristic — First Sentence vs Heading-Aware Generation

**Decision**: generate summaries by extracting the first non-trivial sentence from chunk content.

**The problem**: this fails when a chunk opens with a code block or a short bridging sentence rather than a topic-describing sentence. Observed in the fastmcp stdio benchmark:

| Chunk | Summary generated | What the chunk actually covers |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | "You can now run this MCP server by executing `python my_server." | STDIO is the default transport |
| 3 | "STDIO is ideal for: * Local development..." | STDIO transport section |
| 5 | "We recommend using HTTP transport instead of SSE for all new projects." | SSE deprecation + CLI reload |

Chunk 2's summary gives an agent scanning for "stdio configuration" no signal that this chunk is the relevant one. The missed chunk contains the correct answer.

**Proposed fix (deferred)**: prefix the summary with the leaf heading node.

```
summary = "<leaf heading>: <first prose sentence>"
```

For chunk 2 under `### STDIO Transport (Default)`:
```
STDIO Transport (Default): STDIO (Standard Input/Output) is the default transport for FastMCP servers.
```

`heading_path` is already computed before `_generate_summary()` is called in `src/tank/builder/chunking.py`; it just isn't passed through. The change is additive — `summary` remains a plain string, no schema impact.

**Edge cases**: preamble chunks (no heading) fall back to first-sentence behaviour; top-level chunks where heading equals the page title skip the prefix to avoid redundancy; headings over ~60 chars use only the leaf node; chunks opening with a list or code block skip to the next prose sentence.

**Revisit when**: v0.2.0 chunker work begins. Depends on D14 — if chunkana is replaced with a heading-boundary chunker, `heading_path` will be accurate by construction and the prefix heuristic becomes more reliable.

---

## D14: Chunker — chunkana Limitations and Replacement Strategy

**Decision**: use chunkana for MVP structural chunking, accepting its limitations.

**chunkana verdict**: does not support heading-based splitting at arbitrary depth. The `structural` strategy splits only at `##` level, keeping all `###` subsections together. `header_path` is always `[]`; Tank works around this by reading `section_tags[0]`, but this is the ceiling of what chunkana can provide. Observed impact: in the fastmcp benchmark, chunk 5 spans six `###` sections (932 tokens) and is matched by FTS5 on incidental keyword overlap rather than relevance.

**semchunk evaluated and ruled out**: general-purpose recursive delimiter splitter with no markdown heading awareness — a `###` boundary is not a privileged split point. Token-counter-driven rather than structure-driven; would reproduce the multi-section chunk problem. Requires a tokenizer dependency at build time.

**What a replacement needs**:
- Split at heading boundaries at all levels (`##`, `###`, and deeper) as the primary split point
- Treat fenced code blocks as atomic — never split mid-fence
- Split oversized sections at paragraph boundaries
- Build `heading_path` accurately by construction, not inferred from metadata

**Custom chunker option**: the core logic is ~150 lines — parse line by line tracking heading level and fence state, emit a chunk on each heading boundary outside a fence, split oversized chunks at paragraph boundaries. Edge cases are well-defined and the payoff is one-chunk-per-section with correct `heading_path`, which makes D13's heading-prefix summary reliable.

**Before building**: survey available libraries for a production-ready markdown-structure-aware chunker meeting the above criteria. No candidates have been evaluated beyond chunkana and semchunk. Any replacement must be benchmarked against the fastmcp fixture to confirm it resolves the multi-section chunk problem.

**Revisit when**: after D12 (tool split) lands. The chunker affects build quality; the tool surface change affects agent behaviour and is the higher-priority breaking change.

## D15: Pack #2 — mcp@2025-11-25

**Decision**: ship the Model Context Protocol spec (`mcp@2025-11-25`) as the v0.1.1 release artifact alongside fastmcp@3.3.0.

**Rationale**: Tank depends on `mcp` directly, and the MCP tool split (D12) is the largest single v0.2.0 work item — agents using the `search`/`fetch` tools will query this pack constantly. `modelcontextprotocol.io` publishes `llms-full.txt`, making it buildable today without a crawler or HTML extraction.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **httpx@0.28.1**: still pre-1.0 (0.x), no API stability commitment. Rejected.
- **requests**: stable (2.x), good candidate for HTTP client docs, but uses RST source and no llms-full.txt — requires S6 HTML extraction work first.
- **click / rich**: Tank's other deps, but their docs are sparse and less queried by agents.

**Source**: `modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt` (spec version 2025-11-25). Build command (download locally until v0.2.0 URL fetch lands):
```
mkdir /tmp/mcp-docs && curl -o /tmp/mcp-docs/mcp.md https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt
tank build mcp@2025-11-25 --source /tmp/mcp-docs --output ./packs
```

**Revisit when**: never — this is a release artifact decision. Future packs follow the same evaluation process.
