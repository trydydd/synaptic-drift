# Tank — Development Guide

## Source of Truth

- The code is always the source of truth. Never assume something is implemented (or not) just because documentation says so. Check the actual codebase.
- Documentation describes intent and design. The filesystem, tests, and git history describe reality. When they conflict, reality wins — then update the docs.

## Language and Runtime

- Python 3.11+ required. Use `tomllib` from stdlib, no `tomli` backport.
- Prioritize maintainability and readability over cleverness or line count reduction.

## Code Style

- `ruff` and `mypy` are the authority on formatting and type safety. No additional style guide.
- Run all three checks before committing — CI enforces all of them:
  ```
  .venv/bin/ruff check src/ tests/
  .venv/bin/ruff format --check src/ tests/
  .venv/bin/mypy src/
  ```
  To auto-fix formatting: `.venv/bin/ruff format src/ tests/`
- Spell out every parameter explicitly. No `**kwargs` pass-through.
- Prefer dedicated exception classes over generic `ValueError`/`TypeError`. The CLI maps exceptions to specific exit codes and user-facing messages. Start with a base `TankError` class; discover and add specific subclasses during TDD as failure modes emerge.
- Always use type hints. Prefer `str | None` union syntax over `Optional[str]`.

## MVP Design Decisions

- **Summaries**: heuristic generation at build time (first sentence, or leading function/class signature for code-heavy chunks). No LLM dependency. The `summary` field schema supports upgrading the strategy later.
- **source_url**: always populated, never null. Local builds store the path as given to `--source` plus the relative path within it (e.g. `--source ./docs` + `auth/oauth.md` = `docs/auth/oauth.md`). Normalize only `./` off the front. Phase 2 web builds will use full `https://` URLs. No fallback logic needed at query time.

## Build Behavior

- Recurse subdirectories by default. File discovery uses an extension whitelist: `.md`, `.html`, `.htm` for MVP. All other files are skipped with a debug-level log.
- File walk order is lexicographic (sorted by full relative path) to guarantee deterministic chunk ID assignment and reproducible `normalized_content_hash`. This is a correctness requirement, not a preference — any code that assigns chunk IDs must process sources in a defined, sorted order. Phase 2 crawled builds must establish their own deterministic sort (e.g. canonical URL) before assigning IDs.
- `--no-recurse`, `--include`, and `--exclude` are deferred.

## Integrity

- `pack_digest` computation: set `"pack_digest": ""` in manifest.json, assemble the zip, hash the archive bytes, then rewrite the manifest with the real digest. Verification reverses this: replace the value with `""`, hash, compare. The empty-string convention avoids JSON key ordering issues. All ZIP entries use a pinned `date_time` of `(2021, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0)` — the build writes the archive twice and both writes must produce identical ZipInfo metadata for the verifier to reproduce the hash. This date must never change.
- `token_count` is a rough estimate computed as `len(content) // 4`. Document clearly that it is approximate, for budget planning only. No tokenizer dependency.

## Testing

- Red-green-refactor. Write the failing test first, make it pass, then clean up.
- Test error paths and edge cases, not just happy paths. Every public function should have tests for: valid input, invalid input, boundary conditions, and expected failure modes.
- Static fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for integration-level tests (sample source trees, known-good .ctx packs, malformed archives for validator tests). Pytest factory functions for unit tests (individual chunks, normalization edge cases, policy evaluation).
- **Never bypass the public API in tests or benchmarks.** Call the same functions and entry points that real callers use. Reaching past the public interface to call internal helpers directly (e.g. calling `search()` instead of `query_docs()` to work around a limit) masks bugs rather than surfacing them — if the public API can't do what the test needs, that is the bug to fix.

## Docs Structure

- `docs/decisions.md` — permanent record of settled design decisions and their reasoning. Add an entry when a question is resolved.
- `docs/spikes.yaml` — actionable research tasks for parallel subagent dispatch. Add a spike when a question is open; mark it `done` and record the outcome in `decisions.md` when resolved.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — versioned implementation checklist. Current focus version is pinned at the top.

## Architecture Constraints

- The normalization code path (`tank.builder.normalizer`) is shared between builder and verifier. Never duplicate or reimplement normalization logic — both must use the same function to preserve the hash stability guarantee.
- All data stays local. No outbound network calls at query time.
- SQLite FTS5 is the only search backend for MVP. No embedding dependencies.
- SQLite WAL mode enabled on database creation. Busy timeout set to 5000ms.
- HTML handling: for MVP, `.html` files are converted to text via basic tag removal. Boilerplate stripping (nav, footer, breadcrumbs) is deferred to Phase 2 when the crawler lands. Markdown files are the primary supported format.

## Known Gotchas

- **Alpine Linux / PEP 668**: `pip install` fails with "externally-managed-environment" unless `--break-system-packages` is passed or a virtualenv is used. Affects any executor in a PEP 668 environment.

- **FTS5 join syntax**: Use comma-style joins, not `JOIN ... ON`. `FROM chunks_fts, chunks c, packages p WHERE chunks_fts.rowid = c.id` works; `JOIN chunks c ON c.id = chunks_fts.rowid` produces a syntax error. Also: `bm25()` must be called with explicit column weights — `bm25(chunks_fts, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)` — or it returns a tuple instead of a float.

- **FTS5 functions take `Database`, not `sqlite3.Connection`**: `search()` and `get_chunks_by_id()` accept `db: Database` and read `conn = db.conn`. Do not pass a bare `sqlite3.Connection`. `db.conn` has `row_factory = sqlite3.Row` set, so both integer index (`row[0]`) and named key (`row["name"]`) access work — pick one and be consistent within a function.

- **Circular import in `fts.py`**: Importing `Database` at the top of `fts.py` creates a circular import with `storage.db`. Use a `TYPE_CHECKING` guard: `if TYPE_CHECKING: from tank.storage.db import Database`, then annotate with the string `"Database"`. `server.py` has no circular import issue and uses an unconditional top-level import.

- **FastMCP tool names**: `@mcp.tool()` registers the Python function name, not a hyphenated name. `def search_tool()` becomes `"search_tool"`, not `"search"`. Always pass `name=` explicitly: `@mcp.tool(name="search")`.

- **CliRunner and working directory**: `CliRunner.invoke()` does not accept a `cwd=` parameter. CLI commands that use relative `.tank/` paths need the process cwd set. Pattern used in the test suite: `os.chdir(tmp_path)` with a `try/finally` to restore the original cwd. See `_cli_in_cwd()` in `tests/test_integration.py`.

- **Tamper tests must recompute `pack_digest`**: Re-zipping a modified archive changes its binary representation even with identical `manifest.json` bytes, so `pack_digest` verification fails at step 6 before reaching the intended step 7 content hash check. After tampering with chunk content, zero the digest in the manifest, re-zip, hash the result, and write the real digest back before asserting on the verification step.
