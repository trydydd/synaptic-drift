# Tank

Give your AI coding agent documentation it can trust.

---

Tank builds versioned, verifiable documentation packs from your source files and serves them to AI agents locally. No cloud. No embeddings. No API keys. Just your docs, indexed and searchable in milliseconds.

## The Problem

AI coding agents are only as good as the context you give them. Documentation goes stale, gets mixed with outdated versions, or comes from sources you can't verify. When an agent gives you bad advice, you can't tell whether the docs it read were current, correct, or even real.

## How Tank Solves It

Tank packages documentation into `.ctx` packs — portable, versioned archives with built-in integrity verification. Every piece of content carries provenance: where it came from, when it was indexed, and whether it's still trusted.

Your agent queries Tank's local index instead of guessing from training data. Results come back with source attribution so the agent (and you) can reason about freshness and trust.

## The Workflow

```bash
# Package your docs
tank build my-lib@1.0.0 --source ./docs --output ./packs

# Verify the pack is safe and policy-compliant
tank verify ./packs/my-lib@1.0.0.ctx --policy ./policy.toml

# Import into your local index
tank pull ./packs/my-lib@1.0.0.ctx

# Your agent searches the index
tank query "How do I configure auth?" --package my-lib
```

That's it. Four commands: build, verify, pull, query.

## What Your Agent Sees

Tank connects to your AI agent as an MCP server. When the agent needs documentation, it searches your local index and gets back results like this:

```
auth/oauth / Configure OAuth2
  "Configure OAuth2 client credentials flow"
  source: docs/auth/oauth.md
  version: 1.0.0 (stable, approved)
  score: 0.847
```

Every result tells the agent what it found, where it came from, and whether it should be trusted. Deprecated docs get warnings. Revoked docs are excluded entirely.

## Key Properties

**Local-first** — all data stays on your machine. No cloud dependency, no network calls at query time.

**Verifiable** — every pack carries cryptographic hashes. Tampering at any level is detectable before content enters your index.

**Fast** — sub-10ms queries via SQLite full-text search. No embedding model, no vector database, no GPU.

**Source-attributed** — every query result carries provenance metadata. Your agent knows exactly where its information came from.

**Governed** — packs carry lifecycle states (draft, approved, deprecated, revoked) and are checked against your policy before import. You control what enters your agents' context.

## Installation

```bash
# Query and serve docs (MCP server)
pip install tank

# Full toolchain (build + verify + pull)
pip install tank[build]
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Connect to Your Agent

Add Tank as an MCP server in your editor's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tank": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "tank.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible client.
